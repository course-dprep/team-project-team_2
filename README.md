# How do movie ratings differ per genre over time?

__Exploring Evolution of IMDB Ratings Across Genres: A Data Preparation Project__


## Motivation


The filmmaking industry is a challeging market due to high and stiff competition. Understanding how different genres affect movie ratings could give filmmakers an competitive advantage. It's interesting to compare the average ratings of movies within a genre to see if their overall quality, as judged by the audiences, is increasing or decreasing. Recognizing trends in genres with consistently high, or increasing audience ratings provides a strong basis for making successful films. By using this information, filmmakers can tailor their  decisions about the choice of a certain genre to meet audience expectations and maximize the chances of success in a crowded market. 


## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.
