# data (Raw data)
Raw data gets downloaded into the data folder of the project (team-project-team_2/data) from either a network drive, or a remote file storage that is securely backed up. I think it is best if we use a remote file storage because we have quite a lot of data to process.

This raw data ideally is stored in CSV or JSON file however I think our file form is quite alright. Normally a data (raw data) folder gets used when there are multiple sources of dat for example: 

````
/data/website_A/...
/data/company_B/...
/data/data_provider_C/2019-11-04/...
/data/data_provider_C/2020-03-01/...
````
Since we only have a few data files all from IMDB developer it will be sufficient just to only store the raw data files without subdirecting them. However this can change during the project so keep this in mind (for example when files are to big to compare and subcategories for in example years is needed)
